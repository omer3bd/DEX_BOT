# DEX_BOT

## project background
this is a personal project made to check for honeypots and other traps that can be found in the blockchain. This helps to find whether or not the dev has renounced the contract (coin), locked liquidity, burned tokens etc. The main goal of the project was to help the redundant work of manual time consuming checks that now can be done by simply copying and pasting in the contact addresses in the bot and it uses APi from etherscan and other websites to verify the credibility of a project.
